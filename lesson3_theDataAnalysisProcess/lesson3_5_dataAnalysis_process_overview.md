### Example Applications
Reporting Dashboards, Analyze A/B Test Results, or CV for Machine Learngine

# 1. Question
 * What am I trying to find out?
 * What problem am I trying to solve?
 - Sometimes data is available, and you try to ask questions based on the patterns you see from the available data.
 - Other times, you may not have the data available, you must generate questions to figure out how you would gather that data.
 - The right questions can help you focus on the relevant parts of your data and direct analysis on meaningful insights
 - Once you have your questions, you are ready for the next step. 
 
# 2. Data Wrangling
 * Gather Data
 * Filter data for your needs
 * Assess Data, to verify quality structure, or if it has any problems
 * Clean the data
 
# 3. Explore 
 * Find patterns of data
 * Visualize relationships of data
 * Build intuition of your data
 * After exploring and reviewing data, you can remove outliers, and create new and more descriptive features from existing data, also known as feature engineering
 * Featuring engineering can significantly increase the quality of your analysis
 * You may often revisit previous steps as you explore deeper into your data. Just like in the weather trends, made new questions and conclusing, made more data wrangling to inspect different pieces of subsets of data.
 
 # 4. Draw Conclusions
 
 
 - Machine Learning
 - Inferential Statistics
 - Descriptive Statistics (What this course will teach)
 
 # 5. Communicate
 * Justify and convey meaning in the insights you found
