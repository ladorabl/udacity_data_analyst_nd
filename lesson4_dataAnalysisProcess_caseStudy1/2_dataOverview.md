# 2. Data Overview
 ## Analyzing Two Data Sets for North Portugal
 1. Red Wine Samples
 2. White Wine Samples
 
### If I was the owner of a winery, how would i use this dataset?
 - Which attributes contribute to quality?
 - Are there any thresholds for each attribute to contribute to quality? This can be used so that I could fix pipeline of wine production earlier rather than later, saving money, and assuring quality 
 - Are there any interesting attribute combinations that contribute to quality?
 - Are any attributes heavly correlated to eachother?
